                                    <li>1 cup Sugar</li>

                                    <li>1/4 cup Milk Powder</li>
                                    <li>1/4 cup Maida (all purpose flour)</li>
                                    <li>1/8 teaspoon (a small pinch) Baking Soda</li>
                                    <li>1 tablespoon Ghee</li>
                                    <li>2-3 tablespoons Milk</li>
                                    <li>Oil or Ghee, for deep frying</li>

                                <h3>Recipe</h3>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Take 1-cup sugar, 3 green cardamom pods, 1½ cups water and 1-2 drops of lemon
                                        juice in a deep pot or pan. Lemon juice is added to prevent syrup from
                                        solidifying when it cools.</li>
                                    <li>Heat it over medium flame and cook until it reaches 1/2 string consistency or
                                        turns little sticky while stirring occasionally in between. It will take around
                                        8-10 minutes over medium flame to reach the required consistency. When sugar
                                        syrup is ready, turn off the flame.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Take 1/4 cup milk powder, 1/4 cup maida and 1/8 teaspoon baking soda in a wide
                                        mouthed bowl.</li>
                                    <li>Mix it well with a spoon and then add 1-tablespoon ghee.</li>
                                    <li>Mix well. Use your hand to mix it so that ghee mixes evenly with milk powder.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Sprinkle 2 tablespoons milk evenly over mixture and gently mix it.</li>
                                    <li>If required, add few more teaspoons of milk and mix lightly. Mixture should be
                                        soft. It may be sticky but do not worry about it. Do not over mix or knead the
                                        mixture, just lightly mix it. If you over mix it, gluten forms and jamun will
                                        turn dense and will not absorb sugar syrup properly.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Grease your palms with oil and divide mixture into marble sized small portions
                                        (around 9-10). Take each portion and make a round shaped crack free ball from
                                        it. If crack appears, it means mixture is dry. Add a teaspoon of milk (or few
                                        drops of milk) to the mixture, mix well and make the ball. Do not make larger
                                        balls as its size will increase to almost double after deep frying and soaking
                                        in sugar syrup.</li>
                                    <li>Heat the ghee or oil for deep frying in a deep kadai or a small pan over medium
                                        flame. When oil is medium hot</li>
                                    <li>Stir gently with a slotted spoon and deep fry over low flame. Within 2-3 minutes
                                        their color will start to turn light golden.</li>
                                    <li>Deep fry until they turn golden brown, it will take around 6-7 minutes.</li>
                                    <li>Heat the sugar syrup for 3-4 minutes and add deep fried jamuns in it. Keep the
                                        jamuns in syrup for at least 2 hours before serving to allow it to absorb the
                                        syrup properly.</li>
                                </ol>

                                    </li>
                                    <li>do not overcook, as the burfi will turn hard. and if the mixture is undercooked
